ConwayUniverse
==============

A small game that I wrote for a friend of mine months ago.
Go ConwayUniverse wiki page to see different patterns.
Compile as "g++ -c conway.c Plate.c" (As I remembered)
And you can play with the a.out or you can compile g++ with other parameter to get an executable you like.
For more pattern information please consult the wiki page of conway universe.
